id="firefly-and-serenity">Firefly and Serenity</h3> <p>The idea for the space
travel calculator was inspired by the television series <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/" title="Firefly on IMDB">Firefly</a>
and its companion movie, <a href="href=%22http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/"
title="Serenity">Serenity</a>. They're great entertainment and even the science
isn't bad, especially by Hollywood standards. It's one of the few Hollywood
movies to show that there's no sound in space. There are no aliens and the
humans live on terraformed planets. The show's dubious handling of gravity is
easily forgiven since it was a relatively low-budget affair and it's hard to
film people floating about spacecrafts. Nevertheless, there's a big scientific
problem in the storyline: how did millions of people migrate from earth to a
planet-filled sun-system a mere 500 years from now, and have the time and
resources to terraform so many planets?</p> <p>Let's assume that this wonderful
system is Proxima Centauri, our nearest stellar neigbour. Being a red dwarf,
Proxima Centauri is not a good candidate for livable planets, but let's ignore
that.</p> <p>Proxima Centauri is 4.2 light-years away. Let's say the first
generation of humans to leave earth came in spacecrafts the size of the Firefly
carrying young people prepared to spend most of the rest of their lives on a
spaceship. If they'd travelled at a constant acceleration of 1g or
9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> for the first half of the journey, followed by the same
constant deceleration, they would have got there in just three and a half
years. This is a pleasant rate of acceleration because it would allow them to
experience gravity for the duration of their journey as it is on earth.</p>
<p>The problem though is that they would have needed to carry far more fuel than
the maximum capacity of their spacecrafts. In fact no matter what the mass of
their spacecrafts, they would have needed much more fuel than they could carry
to get there in such quick time. Even the most efficient spacecrafts, that
convert their fuel mass into energy at the rate of e=mc<sup>2</sup> (e.g. by
using matter-antimatter annihilation), would always need more than four times as
much fuel as the total mass of the spacecraft (including fuel), when they
launch, to maintain that acceleration, which is impossible. As it is, the most
likely interstellar fuel mass into energy efficiency we're likely to achieve is
only 0.008mc<sup>2</sup> (hydrogen fusion into helium).</p> <p>Methods of
powering spacecraft for interstellar flight without onboard fuel have been
proposed. They're quite unlikely though. More importantly, there are scenes in
the series which make it clear that the technology of the day depends on onboard
fuel.</p> <p>Let's say our earth emigrants are prepared to tolerate an extremely
long journey in space and no gravity for a long period of time. Then what's a
realistically achievable amount of time to get from earth to Proxima Centauri?
Well, about 90 odd years, assuming that there are some tremendous technological
developments in the next few centuries. In this scenario, almost all the weight
of the spacecrafts would be taken by fuel, at least for a large part of the
first half of the journey. The crafts would be powered with nuclear fusion. They
would accelerate for half the journey at a stately 0.017m/s<sup>2</sup> and then
decelerate at the same rate until the destination was reached.</p> <p>It is
conceivable that we'll be able to live extremely long lives or that living in
stasis will become possible. We haven't even considered other massive
technological challenges that have to be overcome to make the migration of the
Firefly world possible, like terraforming planets, finding a star with so many
planets that have an earth-like climate and gravitational pull, ensuring there's
enough food to eat on the spacecrafts for so long a journey and much, much
more. But the state of humanity depicted in the Firefly series, while
improbable, is perhaps not impossible a very long time into the future.</p> <h3
id="star-trek">Star Trek</h3> <p>The <a href="href=%22http://www.startrek.com/"
title="Star Trek series">Star Trek series</a> are wonderful entertainment and
offer a multitude of interesting scientific and logical conundrums, but the
space travel science in all the series, in fact nearly every episode, is just
awful. None of the characters, none of the spaceships, no-one and nothing
experiences time dilation. That is with the exception of the episodes which
specifically deal with time travel. And those ones are particularly confusing,
rife with bad space travel science.</p> <p>So the Enterprise and Voyager travel
at warp speed, an impossibility, across the galaxy, as do Klingons, Vulcans and
other humanoids. Yet when they return to their home planets or meet comrades on
different ships multiple times across different episodes, their age differences
remain identical. It's just not possible, unless Einstein got it all wrong.</p>
<h3 id="prometheus">Prometheus</h3> <p>Ridley Scott's <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/" title="Alien on IMDB">Alien</a>
prologue, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446714/" title="Prometheus on
IMDB">Prometheus</a> is suspenseful and fun, albeit not nearly as good as
Alien. But the movie's science is awful. Besides its scepticism of evolution
with natural selection, its depiction of space travel is absurd.</p> <p>In two
years, our protagonists travel 34 light years. Even in the most optimistic
scenario that's extremely improbable. But for that massive onboard fuel-driven
spacecraft it's just ridiculous. Also, the spacecraft would have to accelerate
and decelerate at more than 4g for the entire two year journey. That seems a
trifle too much for even someone with James Bond's tough constitution to
tolerate. <a

Biology of Human Survival: Life and Death in Extreme Environments</a> by Claude
A. Piantadosi states:</p> <blockquote> <p>Human volunteers have tolerated 1.5g
for seven days with no apparent ill effects. However, after just twenty-four
hours at 2g, evidence of significant fluid imbalance is detectable. At 3g to 4g
fatigue is limiting, and above 4g cardiovascular factors limit g
tolerance. (p. 200)</p> </blockquote> <p>Then again, they are in stasis for most
of the journey. Perhaps it will one day be possible to invent stasis technology
that allows humans to tolerate any acceleration. It seems highly improbable
though.</p>

<h2>Reader Feedback</h2>

<p><em>Reader Terry McNeeley believes my comments on Star Trek are too harsh. He
writes: "[T]he term warp drive is currently being explored and the determination
of leading scientists is that a hypothetical ship able to bend the fabric of
space in front of and behind it as the ship sits in normal space, effectively
traveling beyond light speed but still existing at a static location as far as
space/time is concerned thus no time dilation effect is present".</em></p>


<p><em>He quotes from a <a
    href="http://www.universetoday.com/89074/what-is-the-alcubierre-warp-drive/">Universe
    Today article</a>:  â€œ...Interpreted in the context of General Relativity, the metric allows a warp bubble to appear in a previously flat region of spacetime and move away, effectively at speeds that exceed the speed of light. The interior of the bubble is the inertial reference frame for any object inhabiting it.
    Since the ship is not moving within this bubble, but is being carried along as the region itself moves, conventional relativistic effects such as time dilation would not apply. Hence, the rules of space-time and the laws of relativity would not be violated in the conventional sense."
